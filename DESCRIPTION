Description: Provides efficient tools for computing martingale difference correlation (MDC), martingale difference divergence (MDD), and their partial extensions to assess conditional mean dependence. Separately, the package introduces a novel hypothesis test for detecting covariate effects on the cure rate in mixture cure models, using MDC-based statistics. These methods enable both general dependence analysis and targeted inference in survival models with a cure fraction.
